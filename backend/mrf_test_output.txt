FULL AGENT OUTPUTS:
============================================================

==================== QUANT AGENT ====================
ANALYSIS TEXT:
MRF.NS has a high P/E ratio of 28.26 and an extremely high debt-to-equity ratio of 18.68, which is anomalous and indicates severe leverage risk. Revenue growth is solid at 15% and ROCE is 13.8%, but ROE is missing, and earnings growth of 119.3% is suspiciously high compared to revenue growth, adding significant uncertainty.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
  Score: 35
  Trend: N/A
  Alignment: N/A
  Risk Level: N/A
  Strengths: ['Revenue growth of 15%', 'ROCE of 13.8%']
  Weaknesses: ['P/E ratio of 28.26 is high', 'Debt-to-equity ratio of 18.68 is extremely high and likely anomalous', 'ROE data missing']
  Confidence: 35
  Data Quality: Medium

==================== MACRO AGENT ====================
ANALYSIS TEXT:
India VIX is at 11.665 with a -4.31% change and interpreted as 'Low Volatility / Complacency', while Nifty (^NSEI) is at 25935.15, up 0.26%. RBI repo rate stands at 5.25% against inflation of 4.95%, and US interest rate proxy ^TNX decreased by 1.12%, suggesting mixed signals with low volatility but modest index gains.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
  Score: 45
  Trend: Neutral
  Alignment: N/A
  Risk Level: N/A
  Strengths: []
  Weaknesses: []
  Confidence: 70
  Data Quality: High

==================== PHILOSOPHER AGENT ====================
ANALYSIS TEXT:
MRF exhibits high insider ownership at 47.92% (held_percent_insiders: 0.4792), which may align management interests with shareholders, but debt-to-equity is elevated at 18.68, raising financial risk concerns. Provided data lacks information on environmental practices, social impact, and sustainable competitive advantages, limiting a comprehensive ethical assessment.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
  Score: 45
  Trend: N/A
  Alignment: Medium
  Risk Level: N/A
  Strengths: ['High insider ownership (47.92%) potentially enhancing governance and accountability']
  Weaknesses: ['Debt-to-equity ratio of 18.68 suggests significant leverage and financial vulnerability', 'No disclosed environmental or social metrics in the provided data, indicating transparency gaps']
  Confidence: 40
  Data Quality: High

==================== REGRET AGENT ====================
ANALYSIS TEXT:
MRF.NS exhibits high stock-specific volatility at 24.26% annualized and a PE ratio of 28.26, indicating valuation sensitivity. Earnings growth of 119.3% is anomalously high and may not be sustainable, while debt-to-equity of 18.68 appears elevated. Macro risks are muted with India VIX at 11.665 (Low Volatility), but sector cyclicality in Auto Parts poses downside if auto demand falls.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
  Score: 27
  Trend: N/A
  Alignment: N/A
  Risk Level: High
  Strengths: []
  Weaknesses: ["Severe Indian auto sales slowdown (e.g., 20% decline) reduces MRF's revenue and profits, amplified by high volatility, leading to 35-40% price drawdown from current levels.", 'Earnings growth reverts to revenue growth rate (15%), causing PE contraction from 28.26 towards forward PE of 23.08 or lower, resulting in 20-25% price decline.']
  Confidence: 75
  Data Quality: High

==================== COACH SYNTHESIZER ====================
VERDICT: N/A
SYNTHESIS:
MRF's debt-to-equity ratio is anomalously high at 18.68, and earnings growth of 119.3% is suspicious compared to 15% revenue growth, indicating potential earnings quality issues. Stock volatility is elevated at 24.26% annualized, and Auto Parts sector cyclicality poses downside risks, though low India VIX at 11.665 suggests stable macro conditions....
